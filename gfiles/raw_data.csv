"The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $20,578 in 2019. This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid. For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm). For 2019 and historical thresholds, use [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html)."
