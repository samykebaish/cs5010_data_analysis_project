## Introduction
Mental health impacts everyone on an individual level, but it can be hard to visualize what the distribution of mental illness and treatment are across the United States. Using descriptive statistics, exploratory analyses, and an interactive website complete with visualizations was created to help patients, treatment providers, and the general public engage with diagnostic and healthcare information regarding mental illness and care. Additionally, trend analyses and traditional and machine-learning (ML) modeling methods were used to observe shifts over time and predict level of care and mental health diagnoses.
