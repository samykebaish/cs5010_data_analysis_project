## Introduction
Mental health impacts everyone on an individual level, but it can be hard to visualize what the distribution of mental illness and treatment are across the United States. Using descriptive statistics, exploratory analyses, and an interactive website complete with visualizations was created to help patients, treatment providers, and the general public engage with diagnostic and healthcare information regarding mental illness and care. Additionally, trend analyses and traditional and machine-learning (ML) modeling methods were used to observe shifts over time and predict level of care and mental health diagnoses.

## Datasets
Our primary datasets include Adult and Child Health Care Quality Measures for fiscal year 2018. Each year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) collects benchmark data from a variety of treatment providers, with the goal of summarizing the quality of care received by adult Medicaid recipients and CHIP beneficieries.  We also used the Mental Health Client-Level Data (MH-CLD) from SAHMSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a part of the US Department of Health and Human Services). We primarily focused on the year 2018, but trend analyses included data from 2013-2018. For some supplemental information regarding poverty by state, we utilized the Kaiser Family Foundation's State Facts database summarizing poverty rate by race and ethnicity, and geoJson files containing location coordinates for US state boundaries (Story and Fernandez, 2016), and state abbreviation/FIPS (World Population Review (n.d.)) to generate choropleths and merge datasets which utilized different encoding methods for state.

### Adult and Child Health Care Quality Measures

### MH-CLD


### KFF Datasets
Based on US Census surveys, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated the rate of people living at or under the federal poverty line for the year 2018 and grouped that data by state, race, and ethnicity.

### Geographic Data

## Tech Stack
Code was written in Jupyter Notebook (Kluyver et al., 2016) for reproducibility and easy annotation.

Much of the exploratory data analysis was conducted with functions imported from NumPy (Harris et al., 2020) and Pandas (McKinney et al., 2010).

Visualizations for the exploratory data analysis were produced using Matplotlib (Hunter et al., 2007) and seaborn (Waskom et al., 2017). Plotly (Plotly Technologies Inc, 2015) was used to create further exploratory visualizations, as well as interactive graphics such as choropleths for the website.

Plots related to the logistic regression and advanced ML modeling were created using Plotly (2015) and bokeh (Bokeh Development Team, 2021).

Code for modeling was primarily written using Scikit (Pedregosa et al., 2011), Keras (Chollet et al., 2015), and _Flask (Grinberg, 2018). The website was hosted by AWS.

## Preprocessing
The datasets were carefully cleaned by the governmental and nongovernmental research agencies prior to publishing, so little preprocessing was required. However, null/missing values needed to be accounted for and the datasets needed to be merged together for some of the analyses.

### Irrelevant Data
Rows from the Adult and Child Health Care Quality Measures dataset which involved measures from treatment domains other than "Behavioral Health" were removed in order to focus on measures related to mental health. The rows were identified by filtering out rows from the column "Domain" which were not equal to "Behavioral Health" and excluding them from the dataset.

### Null Data
Null data in the MH-CLD and Adult and Child Health Care Quality Measures datasets were encoded using "#NR" or -9. These cells were removed prior to analysis and modeling. Since in nearly all cases, the data was categorical, some outlier handling techniques such as imputation with median values or upper quartile values was not possible.

### Joining Datasets
The Health Care Quality Measures dataset was merged with the folio state abbreviation list from World Population Review (n.d.) using state code/abbreviation as the shared identifier. The MH-CLD dataset was joined with the same state abbreviation list using the USPS state name as the shared identifier.

Finally, the merged Health Care Quality Measures data and merged MH-CLD data were then joined using the state code/abbreviation as the shared identifier.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
With the data cleaned, relevant descriptive statistics and other trends could be identified in order to inform the visualizations and prediction models.
### MH-CLD

### Adult and Child Health Care Quality Measures
Overall, the measures using the adult population had a higher percentage of nonmissing data than the child population. On the documentation for the original dataset, SAHMSA indicates that comparison of the child dataset with past years may not be fasible because some measures were only created or standardized in recent years. As a result of the changes, many states do not have sufficient data to be included in the analyses.

## General Linearized Model

### Principal Component Analysis
A Principal Component Analysis was used to evaluate all variables in the combined CLD-Health Care Quality Measures dataset.
